# Ada Array Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to implicit type conversion and array manipulation in Ada.  The bug can result in unexpected or incorrect program behavior. The provided Ada code highlights the issue and demonstrates a solution.

## Bug Description
The core issue revolves around the implicit handling of numeric types when performing operations on arrays.  When working with arrays of a specific numeric type, ensure that calculations and conversions do not lead to unintended type changes that might affect the accuracy or correctness of the resulting operations and array content. 

## Solution
The solution focuses on explicit type conversions or using appropriate numeric types from the beginning to prevent implicit conversions that may cause problems.  Always exercise caution and be aware of the implications of implicit type conversions, particularly when manipulating array elements.
